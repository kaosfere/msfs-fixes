# Lighting fix for the MSFS TBM930

The stock TBM930 in MSFS does not allow you to control the brightness of the G3000 displays, which makes flying at night painful.  It seems as though, for some reason, this plane was built with the displays configured for static brightness.  This fixes that.  After installing this, all three screens' brightness is controlled by the panel lighting knob.

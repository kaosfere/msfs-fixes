# Lighting fix for the MSFS DA62

The stock DA62 in MSFS does not allow you to control the brightness of the G1000 displays, which makes flying at night painful.  The potentiometer that they use by default to control brightness is not present in the DA62 cockpit.  This change updates them to be controlled via the instrument lighting knob.  The central artificial horizon is not updating at this point for reasons yet to be determined.

# Lighting fix for the MSFS DA62 - Special Cabin Heat Edition

This is a special edition of my [DA62 lighting fix](https://github.com/kaosfere/msfs-fixes/tree/master/fixes/da62_lighting_fix), altered to use the cabin heat lever for control of display brightness.  This was [requested by ThomseN_inc](https://www.avsim.com/forums/topic/582816-da62-g1000-lighting-fix/?do=findComment&comment=4326464) on the Avsim forums.

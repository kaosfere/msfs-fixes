# MSFS Tweaks and Fixes

This will be a repository for various tweaks, fixes, or enhancements for the new Microsoft Flight Simulator.

There are only a few things here currently:

* small lighting fixes for the [TBM930](fixes/tbm930_lighting_fix/), [DA62](fixes/da62_lighting_fix/), and [DA40NG](fixes/da40ng_lighting_fix/)
* a [python script](bin/build.py) which can be used to build a package with a correct `layout.json`
